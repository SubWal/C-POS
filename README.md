# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

As a software engineer, my goal is to continually improve my understanding and skills in software development. For this project, I created a POS (Point of Sale) system application in C++. This project was very helpful in enhancing my knowledge of C++ and allowed me to apply concepts I had previously learned in Python, such as threading, to create engaging animations in C++.

Software Description

The POS system is a command-based self-checkout application. Users can add items to their cart from a predefined menu or specify custom items along with their prices. The application allows users to:

Add items to their cart
Remove items from their cart
Check the current status of their cart
Proceed to checkout, where they can enter the payment amount and receive change

Purpose:

The primary purpose of creating this software was to deepen my understanding of C++ by implementing a practical application. This project helped me:

Explore object-oriented programming in C++
Understand the use of polymorphism and inheritance
Implement a simple user interface using the console
Learn about dynamic memory management
Apply threading for creating animations during the checkout process

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
